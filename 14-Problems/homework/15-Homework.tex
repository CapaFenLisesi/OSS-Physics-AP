\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=15pt]

\item A lead box containing radioactive materials that emit both electrons and
  positrons is placed near an apparatus consisting of an evacuated capacitor
  that is filled with a magnetic field, as shown in the figure. Electrons that
  enter along the center line of the capacitor plates travel straight through
  (undeflected) with a velocity of $v=\SI{1.0e7}{m/s}$ and out
  the hole in the center of the apparatus on the right. The capacitor plates
  are separated by a distance of $d=\SI{0.020}{\metre}$; each plate has an area
  of $A=\SI{1.0e-4}{m^2}$ and a potential difference of $\Delta V$. A uniform
  magnetic field of $B=\SI{0.030}{\tesla}$ is directed out of the page between
  the plates, as shown in the figure.

      undeflected. Support your argument with an algebraic equation
      and an appropriately drawn force diagram.

      electrons, will also travel straight through the device undeflected.
