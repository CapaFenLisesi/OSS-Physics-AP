  \frametitle{Introduction}
  These slides are an expanded version of the slides used for Grade 12 Physics
  (with some additional calculus). Two versions of the slides are downloadable
  from the school website:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The long version
    \begin{itemize}
    \item More background information (more than needed for the AP 2 Exam) and
      derivations and integrations
    \item May answer some of your questions about the specifics of the theory
    \item \texttt{23a-relativity\_long.pdf}
    \end{itemize}
  \item The short version
    \begin{itemize}
    \item More ``to the point''
    \item The version that is used during class
    \item \texttt{23a-relativity\_short.pdf}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  There is also a handout on how to solve and interpret the time dilation
  problem

  \frametitle{Frame of Reference}
  \framesubtitle{A Quick Review}
  A \textbf{frame of reference} (or ``reference frame'', or just ``frame'') is
  a hypothetical mobile ``laboratory'' an observer uses to make measurements
  (e.g.\ mass, lengths, time). At a minimum, it includes:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A ruler to measure lengths
  \item A clock to measure the passage of time
  \item A scale to compare forces
  \item A balance to measure masses
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{.15in}\textcolor{red!85}{High-school textbooks often refer to the
    frame of reference as a ``coordinate system''. While it certainly includes
    that, this definition often makes it difficult to understand special
    relativity.}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Frame of Reference}
  \framesubtitle{A Quick Review}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We assume that the hypothetical laboratory is \emph{perfect}---the
    hypothetical ``instruments'' have zero errors
  \item What matters is the \emph{motion} (at rest, uniform motion, acceleration
    etc) of your laboratory, and how it affects the measurement that you make
  \item ``From the point of view of\ldots''
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Newtonian (Classical) Relativity}

  In Newtonian physics, space and time are \emph{absolute}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \SI{1}{m} is \SI{1}{m} no matter where you are in the universe
  \item \SI{1}{s} is \SI{1}{s} no matter where you are in the universe
  \item Measurements of space and time do not depend on motion
  \end{itemize}
  If space and time are absolute, then \emph{all} velocities are relative
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Measured velocities depend on the motion of the observer
  \end{itemize}
  An \textbf{inertial frame of reference} is moving in uniform motion (constant
  velocity, zero acceleration)


  \vspace{.2in}
  \begin{block}{The Principle of Relativity}
    All laws of physics must apply equally in all inertial frames of reference.

  \frametitle{Inertial Frame of Reference}
  \framesubtitle{A Quick Review}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Observer A is moving with the skateboard at a constant velocity
  \item Observer B is standing on the side of the road
  \item Both observers see different motion, but they agree on the equations
    that govern the motion

  \frametitle{Peculiar features of Maxwell's equation}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Does not mention the \emph{medium} in which EM waves travels
  \item When applying \emph{Galilean transformation} (classical equation for
    adding velocities) to Maxwell's equations, asymmetry is introduced
  \item Gauss's law for magnetism break down: magnetic field lines appear to
    have beginnings/ends
  \item In \emph{some} inertial frames of reference,
    Maxwell's equations are simple and elegant, but in another inertial frame
    of reference, they are ugly and complex
  \item Physicists at the time theorized that---perhaps---there is/are actually
    \emph{preferred} inertial frame(s) of references
  \item This violate the \emph{principle of relativity}

  \frametitle{The Illusive Aether}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Maxwell's hypothesis: the speed of light $c_0$ is relative to a
    hypothetical ``luminiferous aether''
  \item In order for this ``aether'' (or ``ether'') to exist, it must have some
    fantastic (as in, a fantasy, too good to be true!) properties:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{All} space is filled with aether
    \item Massless
    \item Zero viscosity
    \item Non-dispersive
    \item Incompressible
    \item Continuous at a very small (sub-atomic) scale

  different relative velocity with respect to it:

    \item The two beams are reflected off mirrors and finally arriving at the
      screen where interference patterns are observed
    \item The two paths are the same length, so if the \emph{speed} of the light

  The Michelson-Morley experiment failed to detect the illusive ether, even
  after many refinements. What does this mean?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Majority view
    \begin{itemize}
    \item\textbf{The experiment was flawed!}
    \item Keep improving the experiment (or design a better experiment) and the
      ether will eventually be found
    \end{itemize}
  \item Minority view:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item\textbf{The hypothesis is wrong!}
    \item The experiment showed it for what it is: ether cannot be found
    \end{itemize}
  \item A few physicists: The must be \textbf{another explanation} that saves
    both experiment and theory

      \item believed in the principle of relativity, and therefore
      \item rejected the concept of a preferred frame of reference
      \end{itemize}
    \item The failure of the Michelson-Morley experiment to find the flow of
      ether proves that it does not exist

  \frametitle{Special Relativity}
  \vspace{.15in}Published in the journal \emph{Annalen der Physik} on September
  26, 1905 in the article \emph{On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Submitted on June 30, 1905 and passed for publication
  \item Einstein's third paper that year
  \item Mentions the names of only five other scientists: Newton, Maxwell,
    Hertz, Doppler and Lorentz
  \item Does not have any references to any publications
  \item Ignored by most physicists at first, until Max Planck took interests
  \item Called ``Special relativity'' because it describes a ``special case''
    without effects of gravity
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Postulates of Special Relativity}
  \begin{block}{The Principle of Relativity}
    All laws of physics must apply equally in all inertial frames of reference.
  \end{block}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Reaffirms the principle in which all physics is based on
  \item Extend the principle to include electrodynamics
  \end{itemize}

  \vspace{.1in}
  \begin{block}{The Principle of Invariant Light Speed}
    As measured in any inertial frame of reference, light is always propagated
    in empty space with a definite velocity $c$ that is independent of the
    state of motion of the emitting body.
  \end{block}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Reaffirms the results from Michelson-Morley experiment
  \item Discounts the existances of the  hypothetical ether
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Postulates of Special Relativity}
  The two postulates are unremarkable by themselves, but Einstein is able to
  show that when combined, the consequences are profound
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{What's so Special About Special Relativity?}

  \textbf{Classical (Newtonian) relativity:}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Space and time are absolute (invariant), therefore
  \item The speed of light must be relative to the observer
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Einstein's special relativity:}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The speed of light is absolute (invariant), therefore
  \item Space and time must be relative to the observer
  \end{itemize}

  We must modify our traditional concepts:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Measurement of space (our ruler in the $x$-, $y$- and $z$-directions)
  \item Measurement of time (our clock)
  \item Concept of simultaneity (whether two events happens at the same time)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%  If you see two sets of fire works ignite at exactly the same time--one off to
%  your left and the other far to your right. About \SI{100}{\metre} behind you,

%  the car see the fire works igniting simultaneously or do they think that one
%  set ignited before the other?

\section{Simultaneity}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Simultaneity: A Thought Experiment}
  Lightning bolt strikes the ends of a moving train
  \begin{center}
    \pic{.5}{graphics/87-1-1024x673.png}
  \end{center}
  \vspace{-0.1in}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The man on the ground sees the lightning bolt striking at the same time
  \item The woman on the moving train sees the lightning bolt on the right first
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Simultaneity: A Thought Experiment}
  From the man's perspective:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item He is stationary, but the train is moving
  \item When the lightnings strike, he is at an equal distance from the front
    and the back of the train
  \item The flash from the two lightning bolts arrive at his eyes at the same
    time
  \end{itemize}
  Therefore, his conclusions are:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The two lightnings must have happened at the same time
  \item The woman in the train made the wrong observation: she only thinks that
    the lightning struck the front first because she's moving towards the light
    from the front
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Simultaneity: A Thought Experiment}
  Now, from the woman's perspective:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item\emph{She} and the train are stationary, but the man and the rest of the
    world are moving
  \item When the lightnings strike, she is at an equal distance from the two
    ends of the train
  \item The flash from the front arrive first, then the back
  \end{itemize}
  Therefore, her conclusions are:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Lightnings must have struck the front first
  \item The man on the road made the wrong observation: he only thinks that
    the lightning struck at the same time because he's moving towards the light
    from the back
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Simultaneity: A Thought Experiment}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The two observers disagree on the result, but
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Neither person is wrong
    \item Neither person is misinformed
    \end{itemize}
  \item Both observers are valid \emph{inertial} frames of reference
  \item This means that simultaneity depends on your motion

  \begin{itemize}
  \item $t$ is called the \textbf{proper time}. It is the time measured
    by a person at rest relative to the object or event.
  \item $t'$ is called the \textbf{ordinary time}, \textbf{expanded time}, or
    \textbf{dilated time}. It is the time measured by a moving observer in
    another inertial frame of reference.
    %Since $\bigsqrt$ is always smaller than 1,
    $t'$ is always greater than $t$.

\section{Length Contraction}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Abandoning Concept of Absolute Space: Length Contraction}
  \framesubtitle{Another Example}
  Captain Quick is a comic book hero who can run at nearly the speed of light.
  In his hand, he is carrying a flare with a lit fuse set to explode in
  \SI{1.5}{\micro\second}. The flare must be placed into its bracket before this
  happens. The distance ($L$) between the flare and the bracket is
  \SI{402}{\metre}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Abandoning Concept of Absolute Space: Length Contraction}
  \framesubtitle{Another Example}
  \begin{center}
    \pic{0.85}{graphics/captain-quick.png}
  \end{center}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Abandoning Concept of Absolute Space: Length Contraction}
  \framesubtitle{Another Example}
  If Captain Quick runs at \SI{2.00e8}{m/s}, according to classical mechanics,
  he will not make it in time:
  \begin{displaymath}
    t= \frac{L}{v}=\frac{\SI{402}{m}}{\SI{2.00e8}{m/s}}
    =\SI{2.01e-6}{s}=\SI{2.01}{\micro s}
  \end{displaymath}
  But according to relativistic mechanics, he makes it just in time\ldots
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Abandoning Concept of Absolute Space: Length Contraction}
  \framesubtitle{Another Example}
  To a stationary observer, the time on the flare is slowed:
  \begin{displaymath}
    t'
    = \frac{t}{\bigsqrt}
    = \frac{\SI{1.5e-6}{s}}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2}}
    = \frac{\SI{1.5e-6}{s}}{0.7454}
    = \SI{2.01e-6}{s}
  \end{displaymath}
  The stationary observer sees a passage of time of
  $t'=\SI{2.01}{\micro\second}$, but
  Captain Quick, who is in the same reference frame as the flare, experiences
  a passage of time of $t=\SI{1.50}{\micro\second}$, precisely the
  time for the flare to explode.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Abandoning Concept of Absolute Space: Length Contraction}
  \framesubtitle{Another Example}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item So, if Captain Quick sees only $t=\SI{1.50}{\micro s}$, then
    how far did he travel?
  \item He isn't travelling any faster, so he only other possibility is that
    \textbf{the distance actually got shorter} (in his frame of reference).
  \item How much did the distance contract?
  \end{itemize}
  
  \eq{-.2in}{
    \boxed{L'=L\bigsqrt}
  }

  For this example:
  \begin{displaymath}
    L'=L\bigsqrt=(\SI{402}{m})\cdot\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2}
    =\SI{300}{m}
  \end{displaymath}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Length Contraction}
  Length contraction only occurs in the direction of motion

\end{frame}



\section{Lorentz Factor}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Lorentz Factor}
  The \textbf{Lorentz factor} $\gamma$ is a short-hand for writing length
  contraction, time dilation and relativistic mass:

  \eq{-.2in}{
    \boxed{\gamma=\lorentz}
  }
  
  Then time dilation and length contraction can be written simply as:
  
  \eq{-.1in}{
    \boxed{t' = \gamma t}\quad\boxed{L' = \frac{L}{\gamma}}
  }
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Let's Summarize}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
      \draw[ultra thick,->] (1,.5)--(2,.5) node[pos=0,left] {\textbf{A}};
      \draw[ultra thick,->] (3,0)--(2,0) node[pos=0,right]{\textbf{B}};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  If Person A and Person B are moving at constant velocity relative to one 
  another (doesn't matter if they're moving towards, or away from each other)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item They cannot agree whether any events happens at the same time or not
  \item Each sees the other's clock running slow
  \item Each sees the other ``contracted'' in length along the direction of
    motion
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Example Problem}
  \textbf{Example 2:} A spacecraft passes Earth at a speed of \SI{2.00e8}{m/s}.
  If observers on Earth measure the length of the spacecraft to be
  \SI{554}{m}, how long would it be according to its passengers?
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Lorentz Transformation}
  The equations for time dilation and length contraction only tell part of the
  story. In order to account for the loss of simultaneity from one frame to
  another, we need to use the \textbf{Lorentz transformation:}

  \vspace{-.45in}{\Large
    \begin{align*}
      x' &= \gamma(x-vt)\\
      y' &= y\\
      z' &= z\\
      t' &=\gamma\left(t-\frac{vx}{c^2}\right)
    \end{align*}
  }
  
  \vspace{-.1in}The Lorentz transformation ``solves'' many paradoxes
  (e.g.\ the twin paradox) from the time-dilation and
  length-contraction equations, but aren't really there.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Lorentz Transformation}
  For slow speeds $v\ll c$, Lorentz transformation reduces to the Galilean
  transformation from classical mechanics.

\section{Rel.\ Velocity}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Relative Velocity}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Unlike in classical mechanics, velocities (speeds) do not simply add
  \item If the observer in frame $S$ measures an object moving along the
    $x$-axis at velocity $u$, then the observer in the referenfe frame $S′$
    that is moving at velocity $v$ in the $x$-direction with respect to $S$,
    will measure the object moving with velocity $u′$:

    \eq{-.2in}{
      u'=
      \frac{dx'}{dt'}=
      \frac{\gamma(dx-vdt)}{\gamma(dt-vdx/c^2)}=
      \frac{(dx/dt)-v}{1-(v/c^2)(dx/dt)}=
      \frac{u-v}{1-uv/c^2}
    }
    
  \item The other frame S will measure:
    \eq{-.2in}{
      u=
      \frac{dx}{dt}=
      \frac{\gamma(dx'+vdt')}{\gamma(dt'+vdx'/c^2)}=
      \frac{(dx'/dt')+v}{1+(v/c^2)(dx'/dt')}=
      \frac{u'+v}{1+u'v/c^2}
    }
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

  
\section[Momentum]{Relativistic Momentum}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Relativistic Momentum}
  In Physics 12, you were taught that momentum is mass times velocity. And back
  in Physics 11, you were taught that velocity is displacement over time.
  \textbf{These definitions have not changed.}

  \eq{-.2in}{
    \mb{p}=m\frac{d\mb{x}}{dt}
  }

  \vspace{-.1in}But now that you know $d\mb{x}$ and $dt$ are relativistic
  quantities that depend on motion, we can find a new expression for
  ``relativistic momentum'':
  
  \eq{-.2in}{
    \mb{p}=m\frac{d\mb{x}}{dt}
    =\frac{md\mb{x}}{\bigsqrt\;dt}
    =\frac{m\mb{v}}{\bigsqrt}
  }
\end{frame}


\section[Mass]{Relativistic Mass}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Relativistic Mass}
  From the relativistic momentum expression, we see the relativistic aspect to
  mass as well. The apparent mass $m'$ as measured by a moving observer is
  related to its rest mass (intrinsic mass, invariant mass) $m$ by the Lorentz
  factor:

  \eq{-.18in}{
    \boxed{m'=\frac{m}{\bigsqrt}=\gamma m}
  }
  
  The intrinsic mass has not increased, but a moving observer will note that
  the object behaves as if it is more massive. As $v\rightarrow c$,
  $m\rightarrow\infty$.
\end{frame}



\section[Energy]{Relativistic Energy}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Work and Energy}
  Einstein published a fourth paper in \emph{Annalen der Physik} on November
  21, 1905 (received Sept.\ 27) titled ``Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon
  Its Energy Content?'' (In German: Ist die Tr\"{a}gheit eines K\"{o}rpers von
  seinem Energieinhalt abh\"{a}ngig?)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Einstein deduced the most famous of equations: $E=mc^2$
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Work and Energy}
  In Physics 12, you were taught that force is the rate of change of momentum
  with respect to time. \textbf{This definition has not changed.}

  \eq{-.2in}{
    \mb{F}=\frac{d\mb{p}}{dt}
  }

  \vspace{-.1in}and that work is the integral of the dot product between force
  and displacement vectors. \textbf{This definition has not changed either.}

  \eq{-.2in}{
    W=\int\mb{F}\cdot d\mb{x}=\int\frac{d\mb{p}}{dt}\cdot \mb{dx}
  }

  \vspace{-.1in}Since we now have a relativistic expression for momentum, we
  substitute that new expression into the expression for force, and then
  integrate.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Work and Energy}
  For 1D motion, we can rearrange the terms in the integral:

  \eq{-.2in}{
    W=\int Fdx=\int\frac{dp}{dt}dx=\int vdp
  }
  
  \vspace{-.15in}We assume that both velocity and momentum are continuous in
  time. Since momentum is a function of both $\gamma$ and $v$, we apply the
  chain rule to find the infinitesimal change in momentum ($dp$) with respect
  to $d\gamma$ and $dv$:
  
  \eq{-.3in}{
    p=\gamma mv \quad\rightarrow\quad dp= \gamma dv +vd\gamma
  }

  \vspace{-.15in}Substituting that into the integral, we have:
  
  \eq{-.25in}{
    W=\int vdp=\int mv(\gamma dv +vd\gamma)=
    \int m\left(\gamma vdv +v^2d\gamma\right)
  }
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Work and Energy}
  We want to integrate with respect to $\gamma$, so we need to express $v$
  and $dv$ in terms of $\gamma$ using its definition:

  \eq{-.2in}{
    v^2=c^2\left[1-\left(\frac{1}{\gamma}\right)^2\right]
    \quad\quad
    dv=\frac{c^2}{\gamma^3v}d\gamma
  }
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Work and Energy}
  Putting everything together, we have

  \eq{-.25in}{
    W=\int m(\gamma vdv +v^2d\gamma)=\int m\left[\frac{c^2}{\gamma^2}+
      c^2\left(1-\frac{1}{\gamma^2}\right)\right]d\gamma
  }

  We end up with a surprisingly simple integral:

  \eq{-.2in}{
    W=\int_1^\gamma mc^2d\gamma
  }

  The limit of the integral is from $1$ because at $v=0$, $\gamma=1$
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Work and Kinetic Energy}

  The integral gives us this expression:
  
  \eq{-.15in}{
    W=\gamma mc^2-mc^2 = K
  }

  \vspace{-.15in}We know from the work-kinetic energy theorem that the work $W$
  done is equal to the change in kinetic energy $K$, therefore
  
  \eq{-.2in}{ \boxed{K=m'c^2-mc^2} }

  The minimal energy that any object has, regardless of it's motion (or lack
  of) is its \textbf{rest energy}:
  
  \eq{-.4in}{ E_0=mc^2 }

  \vspace{-.2in}The \textbf{total energy} of an object has is
    
  \eq{-.3in}{
    E_T=m'c^2=\gamma mc^2
  }

  \vspace{-.2in}The difference between total energy and rest energy is the
  kinetic energy:

  \eq{-.3in}{
    K=E_T-E_0
  }
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Relativistic Energy}
  \framesubtitle{What This All Means}
  
  \eq{-.2in}{
    \boxed{E=mc^2}
  }

  \textbf{Mass-energy equivalence}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Whenever there is a change of energy, there is also a change of mass
  \item ``Conservation of mass'' and ``conservation of energy'' must be
    combined into a single concept of \textbf{conservation of mass-energy}
  \item Mass-energy equivalence doesn't merely mean that mass can be converted
    into energy, and vice versa (although this is true), but rather, one can be
    converted into the other
    \textbf{because they are fundamentally the same thing}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

  In a detector, it behaves as if it has a mass of \SI{12.55e-31}{\kilo\gram}.
  How fast is that electron moving relative to the detector?
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Energy-Momentum Relation}
  The \textbf{energy-momentum relation} relates an object's rest (intrinsic)
  mass $m$, total energy $E$, and momentum $p$:

  \eq{-.2in}{
    \boxed{E^2=p^2c^2+m^2c^4}
  }

      Momentum       & $p$ & \si{\kilo\gram\metre/\second}
      (kilogram meters per second) \\
      Rest mass      & $m$ & \si{\kilo\gram} (kilogram)\\
      Speed of light & $c$ & \si{\metre/\second} (meter per second)
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Energy-Momentum Relation}
  This equation is derived using the expression for relativistic momentum:

  \eq{-.2in}{
    p=\gamma mv=\frac{mv}{\bigsqrt}
  }
  If we square both sides of the equation, we get:

  \eq{-.2in}{
    p^2=\gamma^2m^2v^2=\frac{m^2v^2}{1-\left(\frac {v}{c}\right)^2}
  }
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Energy-Momentum Relation}
  Solving for $v^2$ and substituting it back into the Lorentz factor, we
  obtain its alternative form in terms of momentum and mass:

  \eq{-.2in}{
    \gamma =\sqrt{1+\left(\frac {p}{mc}\right)^2}
  }
  Inserting this form of the Lorentz factor into the energy equation, we have

  \eq{-.2in}{
    E=mc^2 \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{p}{mc}\right)^2}
  }

  Which is the same equation as in the last slide.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Energy-Momentum Relation}

  In the \textbf{stationary frame of reference}, (rest frame,
  center-of-momentum frame) the momentum is zero, so the equation simplifies to

  \eq{-.2in}{
    E=mc^2
  }
  where $m$ is the rest mass of the object.

  \vspace{.2in}If the object is \textbf{massless}, as is the case for a
  \textbf{photon}, then the equation reduces to

  \eq{-.4in}{
    E=pc
  }

  But are they really that different?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If space and time are indeed relative quantities, then the relativistic
    equation for $K$ must apply to all velocities
  \item But we know that when $v\ll c$, the Newtonian expression works perfectly
  \item i.e.\ The Newtonian expression for $K$ must be a very good approximation
    for the relativistic expression for $K$ for $v\ll c$

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Binomial Series Expansion}
  The \textbf{binomial series} is the Maclaurin series for the function
  $f(x)=(1+x)^\alpha$, given by:
  
  \eq{-.3in}{
    (1+x)^\alpha=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\left(
    \begin{matrix}

      k
    \end{matrix}
    \right)
    x^k=1+\alpha x + \frac{\alpha(\alpha-1)}{2!}x^2+\cdots
  }

  \vspace{-.15in}In the case of relativistic kinetic energy, we use:

  \eq{-.2in}{
    x=-\left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^2\quad\text{\normalsize and}\quad\quad
    \alpha=-\frac{1}{2}
