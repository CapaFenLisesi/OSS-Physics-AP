%  downward. The rod is places at rest at $t=0$.

%  \item Write the equation of motion for the rod on the rails.
%  \item Show that the terminal speed of the rod down the rail is related to the
%    final charge on the capacitor.

%\item A \SI{10}{cm} by \SI{5}{cm} rectangular loop with resistance
%  \SI{2.5}{\ohm} is pulled through a region of uniform magnetic field
%  $B=\SI{1.7}{\tesla}$ with constant speed $v=\SI{2.4}{cm/s}$. The front of the
%  loop enters the region of the magnetic field at time $t=0$.
%  \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,leftmargin=18pt]
%  \item Find and graph the flux through the loop as a function of time.
%  \item Find and graph the included emf and the current in the loop as a
%    function of time. Neglect any self inductance of the loop and extend your
%    graph from $t=0$ to $t=\SI{16}{\second}$.
