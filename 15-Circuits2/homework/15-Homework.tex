    5 Questions}
\end{center}

\textbf{Directions:} Answer all questions. The suggested time is about 10
minutes for answering each of the questions. The parts within a question may
not have equal weight. All final numerical answers should include appropriate
units. Credit depends on the quality of your solutions and explanations, so you
should show your work. Credit also depends on demonstrating that you know which
physical principles would be appropriate to apply in a particular situation.
Therefore, you should clearly indicate which part of a question your work is
for.

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=15pt]

\item A lead box containing radioactive materials that emit both electrons and
  positrons is placed near an apparatus consisting of an evacuated capacitor
  that is filled with a magnetic field, as shown in the figure. Electrons that
  enter along the center line of the capacitor plates travel straight through
  (undeflected) with a velocity of $v=\SI{1.0e7}{m/s}$ and out
  the hole in the center of the apparatus on the right. The capacitor plates
  are separated by a distance of $d=\SI{0.020}{\metre}$; each plate has an area
  of $A=\SI{1.0e-4}{m^2}$ and a potential difference of $\Delta V$. A uniform
  magnetic field of $B=\SI{0.030}{\tesla}$ is directed out of the page between
  the plates, as shown in the figure.

  \item\vspace{-.2in} Explain why it is acceptable to neglect the effects of
    gravity on the electrons passing through the apparatus.
  \item
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Explain why the electrons pass through the capacitor plates
      undeflected. Support your argument with an algebraic equation
      and an appropriately drawn force diagram.

    \item Use your equation to calculate the potential difference ($\Delta V$)
      between the capacitor plates.

    \item Which capacitor plate has the highest potential? Justify your 
      reasoning making reference to the electric field.

    \item Calculate the magnitude of the energy that is stored in the capacitor.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item A positron enters the apparatus along the same path as the
    electrons from part (b).
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Explain why the positron, traveling at the same speed as the
      electrons, will also travel straight through the device undeflected.
      Support your argument with an equation.
    \item A second positron enters the apparatus at a speed of $2v$. Sketch
      the path of the positron through the capacitor plates on the figure.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item An electron exits the apparatus at a velocity of $v=\SI{1.0e7}{m/s}$
    parallel to a long wire of a circuit, as shown in the figure. The
    distance between the electron and the wire is \SI{1}{mm}.
