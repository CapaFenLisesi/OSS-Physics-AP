\item Two positive charges $+q$ are on the $y$ axis at $y=+a$ and $y=-a$.
  \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
  \item Show that the electric field on the $x$ axis is along the $x$ axis with
    $E_x=2kqx(x^2+a^2)^{-3/2}$.
  \item Show that near the origin, when $x\ll a$, $E_x\approx 2kqx/a^3$.
  \item Show that for $x\gg a$, $E_x\approx 2kq/x^2$.
  \item Explain why you should expect the result in (c) even before calculating
    it.

  A bead of mass $m$ with a negative charge $-q$ slides along a thread that
  runs along the $x$ axis.
  \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
  \item Show that for small displacements $x\ll a$, the bead experiences a
    restoring force that is proportional to $x$ and therefore undergoes
    simple harmonic motion.
  \item Find the period of the motion.

\item Using Gauss's law, find
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item the electric field strength inside and outside of a uniformly charged
    hollow sphere of radius $R$ and surface charge density $\sigma$ (charge
    per unit area).

  \item the electric field inside and outside an infinitely long cyclindrical
    shell of charge of radius $R$ with charge discibution $\sigma$ (charge
    per unit area).
  \item the electric field strength inside and outside a infinitely long solid
    cylinder of radius $R$ carrying a linear uniform charge density $\rho$
    (charge per unit volume).
  \end{enumerate}
  Hint: In all cases, think about where to put the Gaussian surface. Take
  advantage of symmetry.

\item A parallel-plate capacitor has a capacitance $C_0$ and plate separation
  of $d$. To dielectric slabs of constants $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$, each of
  thickness $d/2$ and having the same area as the plates, are inserted between
  the plates as shown in the figure below. When the free charge on the plates
  are $Q$,
  \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
  \item find the electric field in each of the dielectric
  \item find the potential difference between the plates
  \item show that the new capacitance is given by:
    $\displaystyle C=\frac{\kappa_1\kappa_2}{\kappa_1+\kappa_2}C_0$
  \end{enumerate}

\item Several point charges produce the equipotential lines shown.
  \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
  \item At which point on the diagram is the magnitude of the electric field
    greatest? Explain.
  \item Points C and D are approximately \SI{0.02}{\metre} apart. Point F is
    halfway between points C and D. What is the electric field at point F?
  \item A \SI{5.0}{\micro\coulomb} point charge is moved from point C to point
    E, then to point D by an external force. Determine the work done by the
    external force.
