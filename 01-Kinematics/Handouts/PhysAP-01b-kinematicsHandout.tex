\textbf{Kinematics} is a discipline with in mechanics for describing the
motion of points, bodies (objects), and systems of  bodies (groups of objects).
It is the mathematical representation of the relationship between
\emph{position}, \emph{displacement}, \emph{distance}, \emph{velocity},
\emph{speed} and \emph{acceleration}. Note that kinematics does \emph{not}
deal with what causes motion.

\end{wrapfigure}
\textbf{Position} is a vector describing the location of an object in a
coordinate system (usually \emph{Cartesian} for rectilinear motion, but for
circular motions, the coordinate system can also be \emph{polar} in 2D, or
\emph{cylindrical} or \emph{spherical} in 3D). The origin of the coordinate
system is called ``reference point''.  In the IJK notation for rectilinear
motion, we can express position of an object by its $x$, $y$ and $z$
components. The SI unit for position (and displacement) is \emph{meters}
\si{\meter}:
\begin{equation*}
  \mb{x}(t)=x(t)\bm{\hat{\imath}} + y(t)\bm{\hat{\jmath}} + z(t)\bm{\hat{k}}
\end{equation*}
The position vector is a function of time $t$.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The SI unit for position is a \textbf{meter},\si{\metre}
%\item The components $x$, $y$ and $z$ are the coordinates along those axes
%\end{itemize}



\subsection{Displacement}

\textbf{Displacement} is the change in position from $\mb{x}_i$ to
$\mb{x}_f$ within the
same coordinate system. Like position (and not surprisingly), the SI unit for
displacement is also \emph{meters} \si{\metre}:
\begin{equation*}
  \Delta\mb{x}=\mb{x}_f-\mb{x}_i
  =(x_f-x_i)\bm{\hat{\imath}}+
  (y_f-y_i)\bm{\hat{\jmath}}+
  (z_f-z_i)\bm{\hat{k}}
\end{equation*}
It it illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:d-vs-d}.
\begin{itemize}
\item IJK notation makes vector addition and subtraction less prone to errors
\end{itemize}
Note that since ``reference point'' is the origin of the coordinate system,
i.e.\ $\mb{x}_{\textrm{ref}}=\mb{0}$, any position vector $\mb{x}$ is also its
displacement from the reference point.



\subsection{Distance}%{Similar to Displacement}

\textbf{Distance} $s$ is a quantity that is \emph{similar} (and related) to
displacement. It is the \emph{length of the path} taken when an object moves
from position $\mb{d}_1$ to position $\mb{d}_2$. Unlike displacement, however,
distance is a scalar quantity that is always positive: $s\geq 0$, i.e.\ you can
never walk a \emph{negative} distance to the store.
Because the path is not always a straight line,
%basic cartesian geometry tells us that
%ositive, i.e.\ $s\geq 0$
therefore while the magnitude of the displacement vector is also a scalar,
it is not necessarily the same as distance. In general
\begin{equation*}
  s\geq |\Delta\mb{d}|
\end{equation*}


\subsection{Instantaneous \& Average Velocities}

Velocity is a quantity used to describe how \emph{fast} an object is moving. If
position $\mb{x}(t)$ is differentiable in time $t$, then its
\textbf{instantaneous velocity} $\mb{v}(t)$ can be found at any time $t$ by
differentiating $\mb{x}$ with respect to time. The SI unit for velocity is
\emph{meters per second} \si{\metre\per\second}:
% The
%\textbf{instantaneous velocity} of an object is the rate of change of its
%position vector with respect to time:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{\mb{v}(t)= \frac{d\mb{x}(t)}{dt}}
\end{equation}
Since position $\mb{x}$ has $x$, $y$ and $z$ components in the
$\bm{\hat{\imath}}$, $\bm{\hat{\jmath}}$ and $\bm{\hat{k}}$ directions (they
are linearly independent), we can take the time derivative of every component
to obtain the velocity components $v_x$, $v_y$ and $v_z$ in those directions:
\begin{equation*}
  \mb{v}(t)= \frac{d\mb{x}}{dt}=
  \frac{dx}{dt}\bm{\hat{\imath}} +
  \frac{dy}{dt}\bm{\hat{\jmath}} + \frac{dz}{dt}\bm{\hat{k}}=
  v_x\bm{\hat{\imath}} + v_y\bm{\hat{\jmath}} + v_z\bm{\hat{k}}
\end{equation*}
By the fundamental theorem of calculus, % Eq.~\ref{eq:v-inst} means that
if instantaneous velocity $\mb{v}(t)$ is the rate of change of position
$\mb{x}(t)$ with respect to time $t$, then $\mb{x}(t)$ is the time integral of
$\mb{v}(t)$:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{\mb{x}(t)=\int\mb{v}(t)dt + \mb{x}_0}
\end{equation}
The constant of integration $\mb{x}_0=\mb{x}(0)$ is the object's
\emph{initial position} at $t=0$. As was the case in differentiation,
%As both $\mb{x}$ and $\mb{v}$ are vectors,
we can integrate each component to get $\mb{x}$:
\begin{equation*}
  \mb{x}(t)= \left(
  \int v_x\bm{\hat{\imath}} + \int v_y\bm{\hat{\jmath}} + \int v_z\bm{\hat{k}}
  \right) dt + \mb{x}_0
\end{equation*}


The \textbf{average velocity} ($\overline{\mb{v}}$)\footnote{For
  \emph{time averages}, the convention is to write a bar over the quantity, as
  we have done here. In contrast, for \emph{ensemble averages}, e.g.\ the
  average speeds of many particles, we use the notation
  $\big\langle v\big\rangle$. (See thermodynamics slides later in the course)}
of an object is the change in position $\Delta\mb{x}$ over a finite time
interval $\Delta t$:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{\overline{\mb{v}}= \frac{\Delta\mb{x}}{\Delta t}}
\end{equation}
Like instantaneous velocity, we can find the $x$, $y$ and $z$ components of
average velocity by separating components in each direction:
\begin{equation*}
  \overline{\mb{v}}=
  \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}\bm{\hat{\imath}} +
  \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t}\bm{\hat{\jmath}} +
  \frac{\Delta z}{\Delta t}\bm{\hat{k}} =
  \overline{v}_x\bm{\hat{\imath}} +
  \overline{v}_y\bm{\hat{\jmath}} +
  \overline{v}_z\bm{\hat{k}}
\end{equation*}
%\end{frame}

\subsection{Instantaneous \& Average Speed}
\textbf{Instantaneous speed} $v(t)$ is the rate of change of \emph{distance}
with respect to time.\footnote{It is regrettable that both velocity and speed
  use the symbol $v$, but \emph{c'est la vie}.} Like velocity, the unit for
speed is also \si{\metre\per\second}:
\begin{equation*}
  \boxed{v(t)=\frac{ds}{dt}}
\end{equation*}
Since distance is a scalar quantity, so too is speed. As distance of any path
must always be positive $s>0$, instantaneous speed must also be positive.
Instantaneous speed $v$ is the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity vector
$\mb{v}$. Likewise, \textbf{average speed} $\overline{v}$ is similar to average
velocity: it is the distance travelled over a finite time interval.
\begin{equation*}
  \boxed{\overline{v}=\frac{s}{\Delta t}}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Path}
Sometimes instead of explicitly describing the position $x=x(t)$ and $y=y(t)$,
the path of an object can be given in terms of $x$ coordinate $y=y(x)$, while
giving the $x$ (or $y$) coordinate as a function of time.
\begin{itemize}
\item In this case, substitute the expression for $x(t)$ into $y=y(x)$ to
  get an expression of $y=y(t)$
\item Take derivative using chain rule to get $v_y=v_y(t)$
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Instantaneous and Average Acceleration}

In the same way that velocity is the rate of change in position with respect
to time, \textbf{instantaneous acceleration} $\mb{a}(t)$ is the rate of change
in velocity with respect to time, and the second time derivative of position.
The SI unit for acceleration is \emph{meters per second squared}
\si{\metre\per\second^2}:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{\mb{a}(t)= \frac{d\mb{v}(t)}{dt}=\frac{d^2\mb{x}(t)}{dt^2}}
\end{equation}
Although in Grades 11 and 12, students deal almost exclusively with constant
acceleration, in AP Physics, it must be understood that acceleration can also
vary with time, and that calculus must be used in many cases.
%  \begin{enumerate}
%  \item Take derivative of $\mb{x}(t)$ to get $\mb{v}(t)=\mb{x}'(t)$
%  \item Take derivative again of $\mb{v}(t)$ to get $\mb{a}(t)=\mb{v}'(t)$
%  \end{enumerate}
%\end{frame}
Again, by the fundamental theorem of calculus, instantaneous velocity
$\mb{v}(t)$ is the time integral of instantaneous acceleration $\mb{a}(t)$:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{\mb{v}(t)=\int\mb{a}(t)dt+\mb{v}_0}
%\end{equation}
%Again, since both $\mb{v}$ and $\mb{a}$ are vectors, we can integrate in each
%direction:
%\begin{equation*}
%  \mb{v}(t)=
  =
    \left(\int a_x\bm{\hat{\imath}} +
    \int a_y\bm{\hat{\jmath}} +
    \int a_z\bm{\hat{k}}\right) dt +\mb{v}_0
\end{equation}

\subsection{Expressing Acceleration as Functions of Position and Velocity}

\subsection{Special Notation When Differentiating With Time}

Physicists and engineers often use a special notation when the derivative is
taken with respect to \emph{time} (and not spatial derivatives), by writing a
dot above the variable for \emph{first} derivative, and \emph{two} dots for
\emph{second} derivative, etc. For example, velocity is
$\mb{v}(t)=\dot{\mb{x}}$ while acceleration is
$\mb{a}(t)= \dot{\mb{v}}=\ddot{\mb{x}}$. This notation will be used occasionally
in this course when it is convenient to do so.


\subsection{Higher Derivatives of Position (For Those Who Are Curious)}

For those who are curious about higher derivatives, the time derivative of
acceleration is called \textbf{jerk} $\mb{j}(t)$ with a unit of
\si{\metre\per\second^3}:
\begin{equation}
  \mb{j}(t)=\frac{d\mb{a}}{dt}=\frac{d^2\mb{v}}{dt^2}=\frac{d^3\mb{x}}{dt^3}
\end{equation}
Jerk is used in many sensors, for example, in accelerometers in airbags to
determine if the acceleration of a car is under normal operation (small $j$
value) or if a crash is in progress (high $j$ value). The time derivative of
jerk is \textbf{jounce}, or \textbf{snap}, with unit of
\si{\metre\per\second^4}:
\begin{equation}
  \mb{s}(t)=\frac{d\mb{j}}{dt}=\frac{d^2\mb{a}}{dt^2}=\frac{d^3\mb{v}}{dt^3}
  =\frac{d^4\mb{x}}{dt^4}
\end{equation}
The next two derivatives of snap is facetiously called \textbf{crackle} and
\textbf{pop}\footnote{As in the cartoon mascots for Kellogg's rice crispies},
but these higher derivatives are rarely used, and will \emph{not} be used in
in AP Physics.



\section{Kinematic Equations}

Although kinematic problems in AP Physics often require calculus, these basic
kinematic equations for constant acceleration are still a very powerful tool.
For constant acceleration $\mb{a}$, velocity can be obtained by integrating
in time:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{\mb{v}(t)=\int \mb{a}dt = \mb{v}_0+ \mb{a}t}
  \label{eq:big5-1}
\end{equation}
where $\mb{v}_0$ is the initial velocity at $t=0$. Integrating again for the
position vector:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{\mb{x}(t)=\int \mb{v}dt=\mb{x}_0+\mb{v}_0t+\frac12 \mb{a}t^2}
  \label{eq:big5-2}
\end{equation}
where $\mb{x}$ is the initial position at $t=0$. The position vector is
quadratic in time.

The derivation of the last equation is slightly more laborious. From
Eqs.~\ref{eq:big5-1} and \ref{eq:big5-2}, if acceleration is constant, then
both the the velocity and position vectors are continuously differentiable. For
simplicity, a one-dimensional problem is presented.
\begin{align*}
  \frac{dv}{dt}&=\frac{dv}{dx}\frac{dx}{dt}\\
  a&=v\frac{dv}{dx}
\end{align*}
Multiplying both sides by $dx$ and integrating, we have:
\begin{align*}
  \int_{x_0}^x adx&=\int_{v_0}^v vdv\\
  a(x-x_0)&=\frac12\left(v^2-v_0^2\right)
\end{align*}
or in the more familiar form:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{v^2 = v_0^2+ 2a(x-x_0)}
  \label{eq:big5-3}
\end{equation}
Eqs.~\ref{eq:big5-1}, \ref{eq:big5-2} and \ref{eq:big5-3} are provided in the
AP Exam equation sheet.
